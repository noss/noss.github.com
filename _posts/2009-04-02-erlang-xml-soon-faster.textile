p(meta). 2009-04-02

Fresh rumour from erlang-questions "OTP is working on xmlerl improvements":http://www.erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2009-April/042870.html, leaked by Kenneth Lundin at OTP himself:

<blockquote cite="http://www.erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2009-April/042870.html">
We are working on significant performance improvements and new API's for XMERL.

The new XMERL will be at least 4 times faster than the current version. The base for this is a completely new SAX parser that you also can use directly with new API's.

The memory consumption will also be significantly reduced.
