title: Erlang release R13A

p(meta). 2009-03-17

"Erlang R13A":http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R13A.readme was just released a couple of hours ago. R13A is an alpha release of R13B. There are some very interesting things in this release.

* The scheduler has finer lock-granularity. Several schedulers, one for each processor/core, better process affinity and cache usage. This will mean better scalability with increasing numbers of cores, proving that Erlang is to depend on when it comes to future multi-core systems.
* A beta release of wxErlang, an erlang application for making desktop guis using "wxWidget":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets
* A new module called unicode for converting unicode character encodings and latin character sets.
