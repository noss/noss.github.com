p(meta). 2009-03-04

Another day, a little bit wiser than yesterday.

Apparently other people have been blogging about "erlang's common test":http://streamhacker.wordpress.com/2008/11/26/unit-testing-with-erlangs-common-test-framework/. And he's much more succinct than me.

Also: Copying common_test and test_server from the installed erlang, and the version suffixes are already there. I have coverage working on "emock":http://frihjul.net/emock. It just worked. Temporarily I installed common_test like this (current working directory in the emock checkout topdir):

{% highlight bash %}
	$ mkdir etc etc/log
	$ cd etc
	$ cp -a /opt/erlang-R12B-5/lib/erlang/lib/common_test-1.3.4 .
	$ cp -a /opt/erlang-R12B-5/lib/erlang/lib/test_server-3.2.4/ .
	$ ./common_test-1.3.4/install.sh $PWD
{% endhighlight %}

Then run @make test@ and the coverage reports are there. And that is how far I got tonight.
