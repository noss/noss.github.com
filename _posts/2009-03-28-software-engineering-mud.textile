I found and read "Big ball of mud":http://www.laputan.org/pub/foote/mud.pdf (pdf, 41 pages) today. It is a paper on software architecture in the "real world".

It has many good reflections, and remarks such as that hard-to-understand code is more evolutionary fit because it is less likely to be comprehended and changed, that is both funny and cynical at the same time.

I recommend the read.
