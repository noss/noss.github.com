title: Erlang list comprehension with no generator
---

p(meta). 2009-03-17

The R13A release readme has this note:

bq. OTP-7846  There will no longer be any warnings for list comprehensions without generators, as such list comprehension have turned out to be useful.

I found it curious what kind of use or possible abuse one could have for this. So I set out for some googling and found this discussion on erlang-questions about "using list comprehensions without a generator":http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2007-April/025950.html.

Thought I would share it with the blargosphere.
