I do not yet know what to use this blog for. It was more that it seemed so simple to start blogging using github pages (and it was!). So I just created it. :)

Some ideas I have had:

* Write short snippets of code and link into the Erlang manual pages for some google linkjuice to them.

* Review "Release It!" from pragmatic programmers, in the context of how the robustness patterns map to Erlang.

* Write public promises of development, so I dont slack, but get stuff done.

* Get a steady flow of usage examples for my projects. 

What should I prioritize?
