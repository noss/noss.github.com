p(meta). 2009-03-21

Some experiments with inline style, and how feed readers filter out style-attributes or values inside style-attributes:

p{color:blue}. This should be blue.

Text here.

p{padding: 20px 0}. This paragraph has 20 pixel of vertical padding.

Text here.

p{padding: 0 20px }. This paragraph has 20 pixel of horizontal padding.

Text here.

p{font-size: x-large}. This paragraph is in x-large font-size.

Test end.
